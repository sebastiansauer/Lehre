**Welcome to the course “Enough Statistics to Be Dangerous: Your Crash Course in Statistical Modeling”**


Dear All,
A warm welcome from my side! My name is Sebastian Sauer, and I'll be your instructor for the upcoming course on statistical modeling.
Relevance of the course topic: Quantitative data analysis is a pivotal aspect of many research projects. While it may seem daunting, practical data analysis can be distilled down to a few overarching principles and methods.


*What you will learn*: In this course, you will gain understanding of elementary concepts of practical statistical modeling that will guide you through your data analysis endeavors. We will focus on typical quantitative research questions, such as analyzing experiments or survey data.
Intended audience: This course is particularly suited for highly motivated learners with limited background in statistics and R. However, basic knowledge in both statistics and R is highly recommended to fully benefit from the course. 


*What you can aspire to achieve*: You will become acquainted with typical modeling techniques after completing this course. Please note that Rome wasn't built in a day: You will need quite a bit of practice after the course to make the concept “yours”.


*Venue*: Please note that this course will be conducted online via Zoom. You will receive Zoom login information in due course.

*Upfront preparation*: Prior to our course, I encourage you to explore the course website at: https://stats-nutshell.netlify.app/. It's crucial to ensure that you have R/RStudio installed and operational for your participation. Instructions and resources for this setup can be found on the course page under 'Upfront Student Preparation'. Additionally, a project repository is available on the (free) cloud version of RStudio at https://rstudio.cloud/content/3421620. Please also check-out this folder: https://github.com/sebastiansauer/Lehre/tree/main/24-WiSe/FAU-2024-09-17_19.
