Hi there!
Let me jot down some notes...


```{r}
1+1
```

# Import data

```{r}
d <- read.csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/palmerpenguins/penguins.csv")

head(d)  # see the first few rows, the "head" of the table
```

Import data from your own machine:

Either use the button "import dataset" or use the `read.csv` command.


```{r}
penguins <- read.csv("~/Downloads/penguins.csv")
```



# Simple model: `y ~ b`

"Y as a function of of a binary input variable (two groups)".

> Is the weight of a penguin a function of the sex of the animal?

Add a code chunk by hitting the button or by typing "Ctr+Alt+I":



```{r}
lm(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = d)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
d |> 
  count(sex)
```
